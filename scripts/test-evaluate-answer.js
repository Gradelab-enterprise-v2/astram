      SECTION B (15 Questions - 2 marks each)
      21. Let ABC be a triangle. Draw a line parallel to BC through A. By alternate angles, ∠A = ∠B and ∠A = ∠C. Therefore, ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
      22. x² - 5x + 6 = 0, (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, x = 2 or x = 3
      23. Area = 1/2 × (8 + 12) × 6 = 60 cm²
      24. 2x + y = 7, x - y = 1. Adding: 3x = 8, x = 8/3. Substituting: y = 5/3
      25. log₂(x) = 3, x = 2³ = 8
      26. Surface area = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2π(4)² + 2π(4)(10) = 32π + 80π = 112π cm²
      27. Assume √2 is rational. Then √2 = p/q where p,q are coprime integers. Squaring: 2 = p²/q², 2q² = p². This means p² is even, so p is even. Let p = 2k. Then 2q² = 4k², q² = 2k². This means q² is even, so q is even. But p and q are coprime, contradiction. Therefore √2 is irrational.
      28. Slope m = (7-3)/(4-2) = 2. Equation: y - 3 = 2(x - 2), y = 2x - 1
      29. Volume = 4/3πr³ = 4/3π(5)³ = 500π/3 cm³
      30. 3x - 2 > 7, 3x > 9, x > 3
      31. f'(x) = 3x² + 4x - 5
      32. Area = ∫₀² x² dx = [x³/3]₀² = 8/3
      33. In rectangle ABCD, AC² = AB² + BC² and BD² = AB² + BC². Therefore AC = BD.
      34. S₂₀ = n/2[2a + (n-1)d] = 20/2[6 + 19×2] = 10[6 + 38] = 440
      35. P(head) = 1/2 = 0.5
      
      SECTION C (10 Questions - 3 marks each)
      36. Let ABC be isosceles with AB = AC. Draw AD perpendicular to BC. In triangles ABD and ACD, AB = AC, AD = AD, ∠ADB = ∠ADC = 90°. By RHS congruence, ∠B = ∠C.
      37. Area = 1/2|0(0-3) + 4(3-0) + 2(0-0)| = 1/2|0 + 12 + 0| = 6 square units
      38. Try x = 1: 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0. So (x-1) is a factor. Long division gives (x-1)(x²-5x+6) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). Roots: x = 1, 2, 3
      39. Volume = 1/3πr²h = 1/3π(6)²(8) = 96π cm³
      40. Let n be odd, then n = 2k+1. Next odd number = 2k+3. Sum of squares = (2k+1)² + (2k+3)² = 4k²+4k+1 + 4k²+12k+9 = 8k²+16k+10 = 4(2k²+4k+2) + 2. This is always divisible by 4.
      41. Equation: (x-3)² + (y+2)² = 25
      42. Area = ∫₀³ (2x+1) dx = [x²+x]₀³ = 9+3 = 12 square units
      43. Let ABC be a triangle. Let D, E, F be midpoints of BC, CA, AB respectively. The medians AD, BE, CF meet at the centroid G, which divides each median in ratio 2:1.
      44. Sum = a/(1-r) = 1/(1-1/2) = 2
      45. Surface area = 2πr² + πr² = 3πr² = 3π(7)² = 147π cm²
