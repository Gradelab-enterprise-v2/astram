# Admin Panel Rules and Guidelines

## Routing
- All admin routes should be prefixed with `/admin`
- Protect all admin routes with authentication middleware
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different admin levels
- Keep route names descriptive and consistent (e.g., `/admin/users`, `/admin/settings`)

## Authentication & Authorization
- Use secure session management
- Implement JWT or similar token-based authentication
- Store authentication tokens securely
- Include CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting for admin endpoints
- Log all authentication attempts and admin actions

## Component Structure
- Place admin components in `components/admin` directory
- Follow atomic design principles:
  - atoms: basic UI elements
  - molecules: groups of atoms
  - organisms: complex UI sections
  - templates: page layouts
  - pages: complete admin views
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Implement consistent error handling

## State Management
- Use centralized state management (Redux/Context API)
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Cache admin data appropriately
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Handle session timeouts gracefully

## API Integration
- Use typed API responses
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Cache API responses where appropriate
- Use environment variables for API endpoints
- Follow RESTful conventions for admin endpoints

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Maintain consistent styling across admin interfaces
- Use a design system for admin components
- Implement responsive design for all admin views
- Show loading states for async operations
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Use clear and consistent iconography

## Data Management
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Allow sorting and filtering of admin data
- Enable data export functionality
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle file uploads securely

## Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper XSS protection
- Use HTTPS for all admin routes
- Implement audit logging
- Regular security audits
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Error Handling
- Implement global error boundary
- Log errors to monitoring service
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Provide fallback UI for errors

## Performance
- Implement code splitting for admin routes
- Optimize bundle size
- Use lazy loading for admin components
- Cache static assets
- Optimize API calls

## Testing
- Write unit tests for admin components
- Implement integration tests for admin flows
- Test different user roles and permissions
- Test error scenarios
- Maintain good test coverage

## Documentation
- Document all admin features
- Keep API documentation up to date
- Document state management patterns
- Include setup instructions
- Document deployment process

## Monitoring
- Implement analytics for admin actions
- Monitor authentication attempts
- Track performance metrics
- Set up error tracking
- Monitor API usage

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Use proper ARIA labels
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Test with screen readers

## Code Quality
- Follow consistent coding style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper linting rules
- Regular code reviews
- Keep dependencies updated
