# Remote-Only Supabase Setup Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ What We've Accomplished

We've successfully simplified the application to use **only remote Supabase** for all operations, removing the complex hybrid configuration.

### âœ… Changes Made

1. **Removed Hybrid Configuration**
   - Deleted `src/lib/supabase-hybrid.ts`
   - Deleted `src/lib/supabase-dual.ts`
   - Updated all imports to use the main `supabase` client

2. **Updated Main Supabase Client**
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts` now uses only remote Supabase
   - Includes retry logic and error handling
   - Simplified environment variable requirements

3. **Updated Storage Configuration**
   - `src/lib/storage-config.ts` now uses the main supabase client
   - All storage operations go to remote Supabase

4. **Updated All Services**
   - `src/services/student-sheets/student-sheets-api.ts` - Uses main supabase client
   - `src/hooks/use-chapter-materials.ts` - Uses main supabase client
   - All other services automatically use the main client

5. **Cleaned Up Scripts**
   - Removed all hybrid-related test scripts
   - Removed local storage setup scripts
   - Kept only remote setup scripts

### ðŸ”§ Current Configuration

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Remote Supabase URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Remote Supabase anonymous key

**All operations now use remote Supabase:**
- âœ… Database operations
- âœ… File storage
- âœ… Edge functions
- âœ… Authentication

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Set up remote storage buckets:**
   - Open: https://mfnhgldghrnjrwlhtvor.supabase.co
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Paste the SQL from clipboard (already copied)
   - Click "Run"

2. **Test the application:**
   - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Test file uploads
   - Test the consolidated `extract-text` function

3. **Verify everything works:**
   - Run: `node scripts/test-remote-setup.js`

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This Setup

1. **Simplified Configuration** - Only one Supabase instance to manage
2. **Better Reliability** - No local instance issues
3. **Easier Deployment** - Everything uses remote services
4. **Consistent Performance** - All operations use the same infrastructure
5. **Reduced Complexity** - No hybrid client logic to maintain

### ðŸ“Š Storage Buckets to Create

The SQL will create these buckets:
- `student-sheets` - Student answer sheets
- `test-papers` - Test papers and answer keys
- `chapter-materials` - Chapter materials
- `profile-images` - User profile pictures
- `gradelab-uploads` - General uploads
- `question-papers` - Question paper uploads

### ðŸ§ª Testing

After setting up storage buckets, run:
```bash
node scripts/test-remote-setup.js
```

This should show:
- âœ… Remote database connection successful
- âœ… Remote storage connection successful
- âœ… Available buckets: [list of created buckets]

### ðŸš€ Ready to Test

Once you've executed the SQL in the remote Supabase dashboard, the application should work perfectly with:
- File uploads to remote storage
- Database operations on remote database
- Edge functions using the consolidated `extract-text` function
