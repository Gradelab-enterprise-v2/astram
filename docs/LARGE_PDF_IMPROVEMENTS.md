# Large PDF Text Extraction Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
For PDFs with more than 40 pages, text extraction was failing even when it completed successfully, showing the error: "Text extraction failed. You can try extracting the text again."

## âœ… Improvements Made

### 1. **Increased Page Limits**
- **Before**: Limited to 10 pages for all documents
- **After**: 
  - Documents â‰¤ 40 pages: Process up to 20 pages
  - Documents > 40 pages: Process up to 50 pages

### 2. **Optimized Batch Processing**
- **Before**: Fixed batch size of 10 pages
- **After**: 
  - Documents â‰¤ 40 pages: 10 pages per batch
  - Documents > 40 pages: 5 pages per batch (smaller batches to prevent timeouts)

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- **Before**: Threw errors even when extraction succeeded
- **After**: 
  - Checks if meaningful text was actually extracted
  - Only throws error if no meaningful text was found
  - Continues processing even if some batches fail

### 4. **Improved Progress Tracking**
- **Before**: Limited progress updates
- **After**: 
  - More frequent progress updates
  - Better metadata tracking (total pages, processed pages, batches)
  - Clearer user feedback about large document processing

### 5. **Enhanced Error Messages**
- **Before**: Generic error messages
- **After**: 
  - Specific messages for large documents
  - Explanation of processing limits
  - Better guidance for users

## ðŸ“Š Processing Logic

### For Large Documents (> 40 pages):
```javascript
const maxPages = Math.min(imageDataUrls.length, 50); // Process up to 50 pages
const batchSize = 5; // Smaller batches to prevent timeouts
```

### For Regular Documents (â‰¤ 40 pages):
```javascript
const maxPages = Math.min(imageDataUrls.length, 20); // Process up to 20 pages
const batchSize = 10; // Larger batches for efficiency
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

1. **Better Success Rate** - Large documents now process successfully
2. **Faster Processing** - Optimized batch sizes for different document sizes
3. **Better User Experience** - Clear progress updates and error messages
4. **More Reliable** - Continues processing even if some batches fail
5. **Better Feedback** - Users understand what's happening with large documents

## ðŸš€ Expected Results

- âœ… **Large PDFs (40+ pages)** - Should now extract text successfully
- âœ… **Progress Updates** - Users see clear progress during extraction
- âœ… **Meaningful Errors** - Only fails when no text is actually extracted
- âœ… **Better Performance** - Optimized for different document sizes

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Upload a large PDF (40+ pages)
2. Start text extraction
3. Monitor progress updates
4. Verify successful completion

The extraction should now work reliably for large documents while providing clear feedback to users.
